the requirements i belive i have achieved are ensuring there was a header footer and nav tags. Implementing css absolute postioning, ensuring all image elements are implemented correctly. I think i utilised css flexbox to create a flexible and resposive layout. 



I had difficulty with the image layouts as it wasnt going in a column and when it did finally go into a column it then had a white border around it. I googled and searched multiple websites including chat gpt and w3 schools to help with this. After reasearching i had found a fix and it was just that i forgot to make the padding and margin to 0 and added a display: block style. 


Is there any way i could get feedback on this assignment as it will help me in the future knowing what i could do better and which parts i did correctly.
